## Overview
This project marks the 4th challenge in my Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp, where we've learned JavaScript fundamentals. Through this challenge, I've gained practical knowledge in various fundamental concepts including variables, primitive types, logical comparison operators, conditional statements, arrays, user interaction using prompts, and implementation of loops like the for loop.

## Description
The challenge involved creating a financial analysis program using JavaScript. The main goal was to determine the number of months included in the datasheet, the net total amount, the average of the changes of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the total amount month with the greatest decrease and increase in profits/losses. By employing a for loop, I iterated through the dataset, comparing consecutive months' profit/loss values to find the month with the most significant decrease and increase. I utilized conditional statements to track and update variables holding the greatest decrease and greatest increase, and corresponding month.
