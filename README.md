# Password-generator

## Overview
This project marks the 5th challenge in my Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp, where we've learned JavaScript fundamentals. Through this challenge, I've gained practical knowledge in various fundamental concepts including objects, objects methods, nested data, looping nested, functions, parameters, scope.

## Description
The challenge entails creating a customized password based on the user's preferences and displaying it on a webpage. It involves a sequence of one prompts to specify the desired password length and four confirmation for the inclusion of numeric, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. The password must be between 8 to 128 characters in length, and at least one character type must be selected. After specifying preferences, the password generator validates the selection to ensure at least one character type is chosen before generating the password. Upon clicking the button, the password will be displayed in the text area.
